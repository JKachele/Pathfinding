FrontierCells//Cells to be evaluated

set all cells to obstacles
set cell[0][0] to blank
calculate all valid cells that are 2 away from cell [0][0]
    if the cell is an obstacle - add cell to frontierCells

while frontierCells is not empty:
    pick random cell from FrontierCells to be current cell

    find all cells 2 away from the current cell that is blank
        set the cell between the current cell and the blank cell to blank

    calculate the FrontierCells from the current cell

    remove the current cell from the frontierCells
